Augumenta Interaction Platform SDK sample applications
===============================================================
The Augumenta Interaction Platform (AIP) SDK enables new interaction methods
for smart glasses and other wearable devices. Hand gesture control combined
with augmented reality is a new, powerful way to control your wearables in
professional and consumer markets. Designed from the ground up for wearable
devices, it addresses the unique nature of these devices, such as limited
computing resources and battery capacity.

Prerequisites
--------------
You will need to access the AIP SDK. You can request access to a 3 month trial
from here: [request access](https://www.augumenta.com/sdk-access-request/)

Example Motion swipes (**swipe/**)
---------------------
This use case demonstrates browsing documents such as manuals, magazines or
books. With a hand passing in front of the camera (using **M001**), swipe it
horizontally to change the page. This could be done with hand poses (hand as a
fist or **P032** is a good example) as well. However, in this example we use a
generic hand as is simpler and more intuitive for general users. Menu browsing
in applications could also be performed in this fashion.

For more information on the API check your User Guide.
